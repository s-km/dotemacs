# .emacs.d

All my emacs config stuff lives here, mostly as a backup in case my SSD fails or I accidentally delete things again (RIP `.vimrc`).

`init.el` is used to parse `init.org`, which is my literate config file. `org-mode` allows you to write a monolithic config
file and manage it easily using headings and constraining emacs lisp code to source blocks so that you can write lots of documentation
for non-trivial settings and functions and come back to them without being lost.
